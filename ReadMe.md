CBC C# Programming Assignment
===============================

This is a small-scale test to verify your familarity with C# and it's usage. It should take you a couple of hours.

This is a small subset of a real image conversion that we needed for particular label printers.

This solution is designed in Visual Studio 2019.


Tasks
-------

1. Install xUnit test framework dependency.
2. Where repeating lines exist replace the second and subsequent repeating lines with ":".
3. Fix broken duplicate lines test.
4. Replace repeating characters in the input string with it's corresponding encoding character (see function for detailed specification).
5. Hex lines ending in "0" or "F" should have all ending sequential "0"s or "F"s replaced with a single "," or "!" respectively.
6. Add tests and code to handle 20+ character repeats which require more than one encoding character.
7. Set the Display project to be the start up project for this solution.
8. Add a data entry field to the Display project.
9. Display the encoded results on the form.


Once you're done create a zip file of the entire solution directory including .git and send it back to us.
